# Human-Age-Recognition

A Deep Learning method for predicting the age class of people from their facial images.

A total of eight distinct classes are present in the training set representing eight different age groups. Considering the unavailability of GPUs and the extra RAM required for big-data training, I took only 900 approx images for each class to train the model (by distinctly augmenting them, wherever was needed). So, a total of 7300 images are taken for training the age detection model for this project.
