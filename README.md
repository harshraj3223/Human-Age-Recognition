# Human-Age-Recognition

Deep Learning method for predicting the age class of people from their facial images.
A total of eight distinct classes are present in the training set representing the eight different age groups. Considering the unavailability of GPUs, I took only 900 approx images for each class to train the model. So, a total of 7300 images are taken for training the age detection model.
